	<h2>Halfway to Iron Man: Hands On With the Myo Motion Control Armband</h2>
	<img src="images/arms.jpeg">
	<p>Technology can be awkward. Our pockets are weighed down with ever-larger smartphones that are a pain to pull out when we’re in a rush. And attempts to make our devices more easily accessible with smart watches have so far fallen flat. But what if a part of your body could become your computer, with a screen on your arm and maybe even a direct link to your brain?</p>
	
	<h2>Could Emerging Sensors Revolutionize Wearable Technology?</h2>
	<img src="images/arms2.jpeg">
	<p>But those devices won’t be the brains behind the systemic change that is coming, according to researchers, technology experts and innovators working to drive this transformation. Those systems will be merely reporting devices. The real solution will be thin, soft, flexible, wireless sensors that adhere to the skin and provide personalized medical data far beyond what is captured by current mobile devices.</p>
