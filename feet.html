	<h2>Siren Care makes a “smart” sock to track diabetic health</h2>
	<img src="images/feet2.png">
	<p>Diabetic health tracking startup Siren Care has created smart socks that use temperature sensors to detect inflammation —    and therefore injury — in realtime for diabetics. 
	Co-founder Ran Ma was working on growing biomass to grow back skin that had been damaged while at Northwestern University when she started learning how to treat diabetic feet and thought of making a wearable that could track and prevent injuries.</p>
